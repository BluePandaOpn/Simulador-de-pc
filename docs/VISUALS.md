# Visual Assets and Demo Capture Guide

This project includes GUI behavior that is best understood visually.

## Expected Captures

Add the following files when updating UI:

### Screenshots (`assets/screenshots`)

- `01-boot-screen.png` - legacy mode before desktop boot
- `02-desktop-overview.png` - desktop mode with explorer + terminal
- `03-runbin-example.png` - terminal executing a `.bin` program
- `04-resized-window.png` - monitor resized, showing adaptive layout

### GIFs (`assets/gifs`)

- `desktop-navigation.gif` - click interactions in explorer
- `runbin-flow.gif` - `binls` then `runbin pulse.bin`

## Capture Notes

- Keep captures at readable zoom.
- Prefer short command examples visible in terminal.
- Avoid sensitive local file paths.
- Update docs if the UI changes significantly.
